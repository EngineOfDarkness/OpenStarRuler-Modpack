All files containing human-readable text (`.txt`, `.as`, `.md`, `.design`, etc.) are licensed under the MIT open source license, unless specified otherwise. (Giving due credit would be nice, though... as would open-sourcing your derivative works!)

All particle systems (`.ps`) are *also* licensed under the MIT license, though their reuse may be complicated.

`.obj` files, should any ever be added to the repository, are an exception to the above clauses, and will *not* be covered under the MIT license. Instead, they are covered under "all other file types".

All other file types (`.ogg`, `.png`, `.obj`, etc.) are considered to be the property of their respective creators and/or copyright holders, and may be removed from the repository at their request. It is not recommended to use these without prior consultation with the relevant authorities (or, at minimum, a copyright lawyer).
