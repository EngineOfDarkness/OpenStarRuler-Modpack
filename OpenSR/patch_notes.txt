v1.0.0

[*] Artificial Intelligence

- AIs will no longer send damaged flagships to battle.
- AIs are now able to build and prioritize outposts to protect their territory or expand beyond systems without planets or resources (including nebulae). Evangelical lifestyles will build star temples instead.
- AIs now expand outside their trade area when they are out of other options.
- AIs now build moon bases on planets when needed (excepted, of course, Star Children).
- AIs now slow down or even temporarily stop their colonization effort when necessary in order to maintain a budget buffer for other expenditures.
- Colonization prioritization has been revised and all randomness in the decision process has been replaced by a deterministic weighting.
- AIs now abandon certain planets if their estimated next budget becomes negative.
- AIs can now choose to focus on one particular area with their budget spending under certain circumstances.
- AIs can now borrow money from their next budget for construction projects critical to their development.
- AIs now build commerce stations to establish trade routes between their territories.
- AIs now build a factory in territories where no labor is available to establish a trade route.
- AIs now build research complexes if their research generation rate is too low.

[*] Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where map generation would sometimes fail due to a script error related to Remnants.
- Fixed a bug where Remnant fleets would attack their own defense stations in Invasion maps.
- Fixed a bug where Flagship Health research nodes would also increase support ship health (Wake of the Heralds DLC only).
- Fixed a bug where the Buy Influence ability on Commerce Stations would display an incorrect cost.
- Fixed a bug where the dry dock construction menu would list different versions of a design under certain circumstances.
- Fixed a bug with asteroid fields orbiting Local Asteroid Field Planets not being rendered in certain circumstances.
- Fixed a bug where persistent beam effects were not restored upon loading a save file.
- Fixed a bug where strategic icons of Ore asteroids spawned when a planet is destroyed were incorrectly set to resource asteroid icons.
- Fixed a bug where Ore asteroids in the mirrored part of a dumbbell galaxy generated with the 'Perfect Mirror' option had a resource asteroid strategic icon.
- Fixed a bug where incremental Ore cost spent to build certain things would refund the next increment's worth of Ore when refunded.
- Fixed a bug where elapsed time was not tracked correctly for empire-related attributes and planet statuses.
- Fixed a bug where status stacks spent to build certain things (like troop pods filled with troops) would only ever refund one instance instead of the correct amount when refunded.
- Fixed a bug where orbital types present in systems tracked by AIs were not loaded from a previously saved game.
- Fixed a bug where packed and unpacked gate status was not tracked by AIs.
- Fixed a bug where mothership population status was not tracked by AIs.
- Fixed a bug where the game would crash when trying to display a Ringworld with certain older graphics card.
