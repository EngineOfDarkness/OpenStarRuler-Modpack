GTT_DEFENSE: <<
	[font=Medium]Global Defense[/font]
	[color=#aaa][i]Global defense automatically creates support ships on planets or systems you have indicated to use it. Right click a system's star to mark it for global defense use. Every point of defense counts as 2 labor for support ship spawning.[/i][/color]

	Global Defense Rate: [vspace=-16/][right]$1[/right][hr=#333/]
	Defense Reserve: [vspace=-16/][right]$3 / $2[/right][hr=#333/]

	[color=#aaa][i]Defense reserve is filled up before ships are spawned automatically. If the defense reserve is full, it can be deployed at any planet to spawn defense ships. While full, global defense generation automatically spawns ships as usual.[/i][/color]
